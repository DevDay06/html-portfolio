<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Dayna, however; I go by Day. I am a mother of two and started my tech journey at the age of 13.
  A friend and I decided to build our own computer the way that we wanted and it was really old. I knew then that 
  I had a passion for technology. 
</p>

<p>In high school I took every computer course possible such as 3d animation design and website development.
  I knew that I wanted to have a caree in tech, I was not sure of the field yet. After highschool I attended 
  college and took a few courses. But life didnt pan out the way I  anticipated. In March of 2021 I took a 
  Course with PerScholas where I was able to fast track and get my technical certificate. I was able to land my
  first tech role with Microsoft. I then moved on to work for a company called Plextrac, this was where I figured 
  out what my passion truly was. At Plextrac I was a provesional services developer. I created code on documents 
  which would provide a document exposing the vulnerabilities within each company. Coding was what gave me that 
  firey burning passion that I desired. 
</p>

<p>Now here I am, working my way up, showcasing who I AM, ready to kick down doors and start my career as a developer.
  Ready to showcase my skills, ready to connect with you all.
